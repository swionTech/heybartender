<h1>Hey, Bartender!</h1>
<p>This is a useful cheatsheet for bartenders (or anyone, really!) that want to quickly look up a cocktail using TheCocktailDB API.  Search for a cocktail in the input field and the API will send you a picture of the cocktail, along with the ingredients and instructions for making it.</p>

<h2>How It's Made</h2>
<span>Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, integration of TheCocktailDB API</span>

<p>I've spent a lot of time working in the hospitality industry, and I thought it would be useful to make an app that lets bartenders quickly look up a drink - whether it's one they've never made before, or a stressful night is giving them brain fog.</p>

<h2>Possible Improvements</h2>
<p>I have not yet made this app responsive, that is the next step.  In addition, I'd like to optimize it in such a way that it will ignore any spaces accidently added to the input field.</p>
