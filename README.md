<h1>Hey, Bartender!</h1>
<p>This is a useful cheatsheet for bartenders (or anyone, really!) that want to quickly look up a cocktail using TheCocktailDB API.  Search for a cocktail in the input field and the API will send you a picture of the cocktail, along with the ingredients and instructions for making it.</p>

<h2>How It's Made</h2>
<span>Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, integration of TheCocktailDB API</span>

<p>This was a fun little project I wanted to do, mainly because I am a big dog person!  I started with a more basic plain colored background, and then updated the look of it using a photo with a gradient overlay.</p>

<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<span>Media Queries for responsiveness:</span>
<p>This app adjusts to the viewport size and is mobile-friendly!</p>

<h2>Possible Improvements</h2>
<p>There are some improvements still needing to be made with the responsive design.  The transparent banner behind the h1 needs to be fixed to format correctly on a smaller veiwport size, along with the text alignment of the dog info.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>I spent some time fighting with the background, both the original and photo, as it kept not fitting just right.  I finally fixed the issue by setting a min-height as 100% in the CSS.</p>
